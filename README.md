# Fraud Detection Project
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is "creditcard.csv", which contains credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed, and contains a total of 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent.

## Code
The project folder contains the following codes:

- Logistic Regression: This file contains the code for training and testing a logistic regression model to detect fraud.

- SVM: This file contains the code for training and testing a support vector machine (SVM) model to detect fraud.

- KNN: This file contains the code for training and testing a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model to detect fraud.

- DNN Classifier: This file contains the code for training and testing a deep neural network (DNN) model to detect fraud.

Each of these files contains a script for training the model and for testing the model

## Report
The project also includes a report `results_report.pdf` that analyzes the results of each machine learning technique used to detect fraud. The report includes the accuracy score, F1 score, recall, precision, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and ROC score for each model. The report also provides a comparison of the performance of each model, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

## Getting Started
To run the code and reproduce the results, you will need to have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- tensoflow

To get started, simply clone this repository and navigate to the folder containing the code for the machine learning technique you want to use. Then, open the python IDLE and run the code to train and test the model.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The results of the analysis show that each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses, and that the best approach depends on the specific requirements of the problem.
